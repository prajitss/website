<p> The earth is best planet for me.As it is only planet to life.It is planet were we live.Earth has four major layers, the central core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. The solid core, where temperatures are really high.
comprises iron and nickel. The outer core surrounding the inner one comprises molten iron and nickel. The mantle is sandwiched between the outer core and
a fairly deep layer of crust.
Earth's surface is covered with mountains, valleys, volcanoes and flat plains. the crust and the upper mantle of earth form the lithosphere. it is broken 
up into plates. Earth quakes are caused by the shifting of these plates. seventy percent of earth's surface is made up of oceans which contain 97 percent of the 
planet's water.</p>

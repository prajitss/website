Neptune has supersonic gusts of wind swirling around it, in fact it is the windiest planet in the entire solar system.
neptune's winds trave at a speed of 2000 kmph. The great dark spot, an oval-shaped storm, was discovered in 1989. it was so huge that it could hold the whole earth in it.
But it was died but new ones which keep forming. triton, the largest moon of neptune, is a very icy cold body and is the only large sized moon that orbit its planet in a 
direction opposite to the planets rotation. this indicates that earlier it may have been a separate object but was later seized by neptune.

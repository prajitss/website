  <h1>The Hottest Planet Venus</h1>

  <p>The second-closest planet to the Sun is Venus, but it is the hottest planet. Why? Its atmosphere is a thick layer of carbon dioxide, so heat that comes in doesn't go out. This is the reason it is so bright at night. It was first landed on by Russia, with the Venera missions.</p>
